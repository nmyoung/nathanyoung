Final Project Proposal

The website I'm going to make for my final project is for a conceptual tech conference called Impact. I've been working on the identity prior to this for a while and I'd like to bring it to life for class. It's basically a one-page, interactive site that serves as the marketing/information hub for the conference.

The Impact site has a clean and futuristic design with a few carousels, scrolling manipulations, a sticky menu, etc. for added functionality. I may make additional pages but as of now I think sticking with anchor points you scroll to best fits my vision for this. Things are subject to change. I've been researching what I can do with Javascript and I'm excited to make little changes that bring the site to life. A lot of conference/festival sites I've been on really play up that component and they make for memorable experiences.

I had a slammed weekend so I didn't get any time to work on it until today, so sorry it's coming in a little late and not quite finished. I'm going to complete the wireframe (tickets and FAQ section) tomorrow afternoon before class.
